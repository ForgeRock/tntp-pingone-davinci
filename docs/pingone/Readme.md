# PingOne

The PingOne node establishes trust between PingOne and Identity Cloud by leveraging a federated connection.

Identity Cloud provides the following artifacts to enable the PingOne node:

* [PingOne service](https://github.com/ForgeRock/tntp-ping-service/tree/cloudprep?tab=readme-ov-file#ping-one-service)
* [PingOne node](TBD)

You must set up the following before using the PingOne node:

* [A PingOne OIDC Application configured to your Identity Cloud instance](https://docs.pingidentity.com/r/en-us/pingone/pingone_creating_verify_policy)
* [PingOne service](https://github.com/ForgeRock/tntp-ping-service/tree/cloudprep?tab=readme-ov-file#ping-one-service)

For more information on this node, refer to the PingOne node
